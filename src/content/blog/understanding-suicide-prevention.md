## Everyone Can Be a Gatekeeper

Suicide prevention is not just the responsibility of mental health professionals. Each of us can play a vital role in preventing suicide by learning to recognize warning signs and knowing how to help. QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) training equips ordinary people with the skills to save lives.

## What is QPR?

QPR stands for Question, Persuade, and Referâ€”three simple steps that anyone can learn to help prevent suicide:

### Question

The first step is to ask directly about suicide. Many people fear that asking about suicide will put the idea in someone's head, but research shows this is not true. In fact, asking the question can be a relief to someone who is struggling.

**How to ask:**
- "Are you thinking about suicide?"
- "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
- "Do you have thoughts of ending your life?"

Be direct, caring, and non-judgmental. If the answer is yes, take it seriously.

### Persuade

The second step is to persuade the person to get help. This doesn't mean you have to solve their problems or become their therapist. It means encouraging them to seek professional help and offering support in that process.

**How to persuade:**
- Listen without judgment
- Express your concern for their well-being
- Acknowledge their pain while offering hope
- Remind them that help is available and that their life matters
- Emphasize that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems

### Refer

The final step is to help connect the person with appropriate resources. This might mean:

- Calling or texting 988 together
- Helping them contact a mental health professional
- Taking them to an emergency room if they are in immediate danger
- Following up to ensure they received help

## Warning Signs to Watch For

While every situation is unique, common warning signs include:

### Behavioral Changes
- Withdrawing from friends, family, and activities
- Increased use of alcohol or drugs
- Acting recklessly
- Giving away prized possessions
- Saying goodbye as if they won't be seen again

### Emotional Changes
- Extreme mood swings
- Overwhelming feelings of hopelessness
- Intense rage or desire for revenge
- Feeling trapped or in unbearable pain
- Talking about being a burden to others

### Verbal Warnings
- "I wish I were dead"
- "Everyone would be better off without me"
- "There's no point in going on"
- "I can't take it anymore"

## A Catholic Approach to Suicide Prevention

As Catholics, our approach to suicide prevention is rooted in:

### The Dignity of Every Person

Every human life has infinite value and dignity. We are all made in the image and likeness of God, and each person's life has meaning and purpose.

### Compassion and Accompaniment

Jesus showed us how to walk with those who suffer. We are called to accompany people in their pain, offering presence, support, and hope without judgment.

### Community Responsibility

We are our brother's keeper. In the Body of Christ, we have a responsibility to care for one another and to ensure that no one suffers alone.

### Hope in God's Mercy

The Church teaches that we should not despair of the eternal salvation of those who have died by suicide. God's mercy is infinite and extends to all, especially those who suffered from mental anguish.
