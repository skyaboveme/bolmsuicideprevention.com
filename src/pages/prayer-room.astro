                        <p class="prayer-line">So often people who have a mental illness are known as their illness; people say that "she is bipolar," or "he is schizophrenic"; when we talk about mental illness, we should not use that phrase.</p>

                    <p>This prayer reminds us of the dignity of every person created in God's image. Mental illness does not define a person – it is a condition they experience, not who they are. As we pray for those struggling with mental health challenges, let us also examine our own hearts and the way we speak about and treat those who suffer.</p>
                    <p>St. Dymphna, who herself fled persecution and is invoked as the patron saint of those with mental illness, intercedes for all who struggle with anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions. May her prayers bring comfort and healing.</p>

                    <p>St. John of God (1495-1550) personally experienced mental illness and understood the suffering it brings. After a profound conversion experience, he dedicated his life to caring for the sick and those with mental illness. His own struggles gave him deep compassion for others who suffered.</p>
                    <p>His words remind us that even in the depths of depression and darkness, we can find consolation in turning to Christ's Passion. When we meditate on Jesus' suffering, we remember that God himself entered into human pain and redeemed it. We are never alone in our struggles – Christ walks with us through every dark valley.</p>

It reminds us that we have the power to transform stigma into belonging, isolation into companionship, and hopelessness into hope.</p>
                    <p>The prayer challenges us to move beyond seeking comfort for ourselves to actively comforting others, and to listen more than we speak. In a world where mental health struggles are often met with silence and shame, we are called to bring light, awareness, and compassionate presence. When we give of ourselves in service to others, we receive far more than we could imagine—and in God's presence, we find the peace that surpasses all understanding.</p>
                    <p>This prayer was written by Lizzy Ojo Martens for Sanctuary Mental Health Ministries (<a href="https://sanctuarymentalhealth.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctuarymentalhealth.org</a>), an organization dedicated to helping faith communities become sanctuaries of hope and healing for people affected by mental health challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>This powerful prayer brings together the wisdom of three recent popes, each emphasizing crucial aspects of the Church's compassionate response to mental illness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pope St. John Paul II</strong> reminds us of the fundamental dignity of every person, emphasizing that mental illness never diminishes the image of God within us. No matter what challenges we face, we remain beloved children of God, created in His image and likeness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pope Benedict XVI</strong> calls us to be like the Good Samaritan, actively caring for those with mental health challenges. He emphasizes the importance of community—ensuring that no one suffering from mental illness is left alone or discriminated against, but instead welcomed and supported.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pope Francis</strong> highlights the integration of faith and professional care, noting that while psychological counseling is indispensable, Christ's words of comfort and invitation also bring healing. He invites us to embrace Jesus' promise of rest for the weary and burdened.</p>
                    <p>Together, these three shepherds of the Church guide us toward a holistic, compassionate, and dignified approach to mental health ministry—one that honors both the spiritual and medical aspects of healing.</p>
