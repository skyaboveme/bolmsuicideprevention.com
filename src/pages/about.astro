                    <p>Too many individuals and families have suffered in silence, bearing the weight of mental illness without adequate spiritual support or understanding from their faith communities.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the compassionate work of the Association of Catholic Mental Health Ministers and guided by the Church's teachings on the dignity of every human person, we established this ministry to be a beacon of hope for those in darkness.</p>
