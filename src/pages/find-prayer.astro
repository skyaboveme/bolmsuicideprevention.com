If my anger is covering deeper pain, fear, or hurt, help me recognize that. Give me the grace to forgive‚Äîothers and myself. Cool my heated emotions and fill me with your peace. St. Francis de Sales, patron of patience, help me respond with gentleness rather than react with rage. Amen.",

            prayer: "Merciful Father, I am weighed down by guilt and shame. I am painfully aware of my failings and sins. But I know that your mercy is greater than any sin. I confess my sins to you and ask for your forgiveness. Help me receive your mercy, not just in my head but in my heart. Break the chains of shame that keep me from experiencing your love. If I need to go to Confession, give me courage to do so. Help me forgive myself as you have forgiven me. St. Peter, who denied Christ but was restored, pray for me. St. Mary Magdalene, who was freed from shame, intercede for me. Amen.",
            additionalHelp: "Guilt about real wrongdoing can be resolved through Confession. Shame that tells you 'you are bad' (not just 'you did something bad') may need to be addressed with a therapist or spiritual director."
