            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Breath of Life Ministries was born from a deep recognition of the urgent need for Catholic mental health ministry and suicide prevention. Too many individuals and families have suffered in silence, bearing the weight of mental illness without adequate spiritual support or understanding from their faith communities.</p>

                <p>Inspired by the compassionate work of the Association of Catholic Mental Health Ministers and guided by the Church's teachings on the dignity of every human person, we established this ministry to be a beacon of hope for those in darkness. Our name, "Breath of Life," reflects our belief that God breathes new life into us, even in our darkest moments, offering renewal, healing, and hope.</p>

                <p>We recognize that suicide is a complex issue involving biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors. The Catholic Church teaches that while suicide is a grave matter, God's mercy is infinite, and we must never lose hope for those who have died by suicide. This balanced, compassionate approach guides all our ministry efforts.</p>
